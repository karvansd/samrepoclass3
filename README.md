Who are you and what is your background?

My name is Samantha and I am actually a environmental restoration practioner. I have worked in forest restoration in both Northern Canada and coral reef restoration over in Myanmar and Thailand.

What are your career goals?

I became interested in FinTech back in October of 2020 when I first learned about blockchain technology and it's various implications it can have in society.

I am hoping to gain experience implementing FinTech applications that makes P2P money transfer easier. After I gain enough experience I would like to find a way to incorporate this into supply chain management.

Why did you choose FinTech as a career path?

I see FinTech as an opportunity to make money transfer and other finance applications accesible to all citizens globally. I think it has a lot potential to drive a lot of positive change in the future.
